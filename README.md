- **Filtering & Search:** Easily filter and search invoices by number, supplier, customer, type, and more.
- **Invoice Viewing:** View invoice details and download as PDF.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firatk/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set the following variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_mongodb_atlas_url
REDIS_URL=your_redis_url

## üèÉ Running the App

You need to run three things in parallel:

### 1. Start the Next.js App

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Start the Workers

In separate terminals, run:

```bash
node workers/documentWorker.js
node workers/invoiceWorker.js
```

### 3. Start Bull Board (Admin Dashboard)

```bash
node bull-board.js
```

Bull Board will be available at [http://localhost:3001/admin/queues](http://localhost:3001/admin/queues)

## üìÇ How It Works

1. **Upload:** Users upload a ZIP file containing multiple XML invoices.
2. **Processing:** The ZIP is extracted, and each XML invoice is processed in the background by workers. Invoice data is extracted and saved to the database.
3. **Categorization:** Invoices are categorized by type, year, and taxpayer.
4. **Viewing:** Users can view, filter, and search invoices. Each invoice can be viewed in detail and downloaded as PDF.
5. **Monitoring:** Admins can monitor the status of background jobs and queues via Bull Board.
